ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System, a Streamlit-based web application that suggests similar movies based on your selection. This project uses content-based filtering with precomputed similarity scores to recommend movies and display their posters interactively.


Features
-Select a movie from a dropdown
-Get 5 similar movie recommendations
-Movie posters fetched dynamically using TMDB API
-Built using cosine similarity on movie metadata

Simple and elegant UI powered by Streamlit

Tech Stack
Python 3
Streamlit â€“ web app framework
Pandas & NumPy â€“ data processing
Scikit-learn â€“ cosine similarity
TMDB API â€“ fetch movie posters

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                           # Streamlit app script
â”œâ”€â”€ movies.csv                       # Movie metadata (title, ID, etc.)

ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/movie_recommender_system.git
cd movie_recommender_system

2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download or generate similarity.pkl
Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limits, the file similarity.pkl (â‰ˆ176MB) is not included in this repository.

You can either:

ðŸ§® Recompute it using the notebook Movie_reccomender_system.ipynb, or
Once you have it, place it in the root folder.

4. Run the app
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py

How It Works
-The user selects a movie title from the dropdown.
-A cosine similarity matrix is used to find the top 5 most similar movies.
-The TMDB API fetches poster images based on each movieâ€™s ID.
-Recommendations are displayed visually with titles and posters.

Example
If you select:
ðŸŽ¥ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a1d6608-cf94-4c25-ac3f-a80a00b4dc52" />

Each with poster images fetched live!

ðŸ”‘ TMDB API Key
This app uses TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch posters.
You must generate your own key:
Sign up at: https://www.themoviedb.org
Go to Settings â†’ API â†’ Create API Key
Add your API key in the fetch_poster() function in app.py
api_key = 'your_api_key_here'

Requirements
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
requests

TFuture Improvements
 Add movie genres and descriptions
 Use collaborative filtering (via surprise or implicit)
 Add search by keyword or actor
 Deploy on Render or Hugging Face Spaces
